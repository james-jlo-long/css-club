# CSS Club

A series of lessons to improve existing CSS knowledge.

## Current Lessons

- 01: [OOCSS](https://james-jlo-long.github.io/css-club/oocss/)

## Software Used

I use reveal.js to handle the slides. This repository contains a version of
reveal.js but I recommend going directly to [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com/)
if you want your own copy - it will be far more up-to-date.

### Basic use

- Use left and right cursor keys to navigate back and forward
- Type `s` to open the notes.

## License

The JavaScript Club files and lessons are licensed under the MIT License.
A very brief summary of the license can be found at [tl;dr
Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and full details can be found
in LICENSE.txt.

Files that are **excluded** from this license are the reveal.js files (located
in the "reveal" folder). At time of writing, these files are also licensed under
MIT (license file included in the "reveal" folder) but the [reveal.js GitHub
repository](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) should be checked for
clarification as I do not own the copyright to that software.
