        <h2>Specificity</h2>
    </section>

    <section>

        <p>CSS selectors have strength that can determine which rules are applied. More complicated selectors have a higher strength or specificity.</p>
        <p class="fragment">When we write, we should take specificity into account. Because we usually write CSS in the order of the design, the specificity is all over the place.</p>

        <pre class="fragment"><code class="css" data-trim>
body { }                /* 0, 0, 0, 1 */
a { }                   /* 0, 0, 0, 1 */
.class-1 { }            /* 0, 0, 1, 0 */
#id { }                 /* 0, 1, 0, 0 */
.class-2 { }            /* 0, 0, 1, 0 */
input[type="text"] { }  /* 0, 0, 1, 1 */
button { }              /* 0, 0, 0, 1 */
        </code></pre>

    </section>

    <section>

        <p>Because specificity is represented by numbers, we can plot them <a href="https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a graph</a></p>
        <img src="./specificity-graph.png" alt="A graph of CSS specificity">

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>This shows specificity against location. Line 0 would be on the left.</p>
            <p>This is the selectors on the previous screen.</p>
        </aside>

    </section>

    <section>
        <p>If we want to add anything, we usually add it to the end.</p>
        <p class="fragment">If we have a conflict, we either need a higher specificity or we have to do horrible things with <code>!important</code>.</p>
        <p class="fragment">... or we have to re-write something, but let's be honest - that never happens.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

        <p>A better solution would be to know that specificity always trends upwards.</p>
        <img src="./specificity-graph-desired.png" alt="A graph of ordered CSS specificity">
        <p class="fragment">Now we know where to put new styles if we want to add anything.</p>

    </section>

    <section>

        <p>We can take this a step further and label these sections so we have a better idea of what to put where.</p>

            <img src="./it-1.png" alt="This triangle also represents the CSS document like before. Line 0 is at the top and line 3000 at the bottom.">

            <img src="./it-3.png" alt="As that happens, each line becomes more and more explicit or opinionated." class="fragment">
            <img src="./it-4.png" alt="Crucially, the reach of each line goes down - each line affects fewer and fewer elements on the page." class="fragment">
            <img src="./it-5.png" alt="We can divide the style sheet back into sections like we did the with the graph and you can see how each layer interacts." class="fragment">
        </div>

        <p id="inverted-alt" class="small"></p>

    </section>

    <section>

        <p>Whenever you add new styles to the page, ask yourself how opinionated the style is.</p>
        <p class="fragment">If it's very opinionated then it needs to be very explicit, so the specificity should be higher and the style should be lower down in the style sheet.</p>
        <p class="fragment">If the style should reach a lot of elements then it needs a low specificity so it shouldn't be very opinionated.</p>
        <p class="fragment">If you solve 2 sides of the triangle, the third one will be solved for you.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>"Opinionated" means that it's less generic. For example if only 1 anchor on the page is red, you wouldn't put color:red on all anchors.</p>

        <h2>The Sculptor Metaphor</h2>
    </section>

    <section>

        <p>A good way of thinking about this is to imagine a sculptor carving a statue.</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="fragment">They get a large slab of marble from a quarry, blown our of the side of a cliff using explosives.</li>
            <li class="fragment">The block is taken to a stone mill who'd make it a sensible shape, like a cuboid, using heavy-duty, industrial tools.</li>
            <li class="fragment">The sculptor takes a large hammer and chisel to get the basic shape of the statue.</li>
            <li class="fragment">As the sculptor wants more detail, they use smaller and smaller tools and get more precise.</li>
        </ol>

    </section>

    <section>

        <p>A sculptor wouldn't go up to a cliff with a small hammer and chisel to carve out the perfect finger before moving onto the perfect hand.</p>
        <p>That would be a very weird way of working and if anything went wrong, they'd have to start again.</p>
        <p class="fragment">In the same way, we shouldn't build CSS like that.</p>
